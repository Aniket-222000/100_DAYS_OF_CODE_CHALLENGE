### I accepted the [#100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) to improve and learn something new every day for at least an hour. That way, I can enhance my coding skills.

- I Will Follow One Basic Rules:

  1.  Code for at least one hour per day for the following 100 days.

  1.  If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day.
